# master-thesis

Files to run the inverse model of my Master's thesis of modelling cosmogenic nuclides to detect past glaciations.

## all_functions.py
Contains all the functions used.
- `forward` calculates the nuclide concentrations with depth
- `find_times` chooses randomly times that are tested as a possible solution
- `inverse` tests if the tested model fits to the reference forward model

## example.py
Contains an example how to run the code.

"test1.txt" and "test2.txt" have an example output from the example.py
